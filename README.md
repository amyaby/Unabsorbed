# ðŸŒŒ Unabsorbed â€” A Dream That Refused to Die

> *A dream that ends, but the journey has just begun.*

Some dreams donâ€™t vanish â€” they echo...
Even when the gates close, even when the path fades, they lingerâ€¦  
in silence, in longing, in hope...

**Unabsorbed** was born from such a dream â€” one I couldnâ€™t finish, yet never truly left behind.  
Though I couldnâ€™t stay inside the walls of **1337**, I carried a drop of that experience with me.  
And with it, I now water the world â€” building something new, from the echoes of what could have been.

This is a blackhole that couldnâ€™t absorb it all.  
A fragment of light escaped â€” and with it, a voice.  
A voice that whispers: *"When dreams break, they donâ€™t have to break you."*

This project is my way to mourn what I couldnâ€™t keep,  
and to honor what still lives within me.  
A quiet tribute to what shaped me,  
and a promise to never let go of what once made my heart beat faster.

**Unabsorbed** is for anyone who ever dared to dream,  
fell, and chose to build anyway.

It is not just a project â€” itâ€™s a pulse.  
A quiet defiance.  
A dream that ends, but the journey has just begun...
